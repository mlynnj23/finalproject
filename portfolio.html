          This project is a recipe for one of my favorite sweet treats, Rice Krispy Treats. Although in the <a href="index.html"> about me</a> section of this portfolio I mentioned that banana bread is my favorite food, Rice Krispy Treats come in a close second.

 This project transports you to my favorite city in the world, Kona, Hawaii. From rich culture to unforgettable experiences, Kona will always have a special place in my heart. Nothing beats the beautiful white sandy beaches and calm ocean breeze.

        <p>Here is <a href="https://mlynnj23.github.io/project5/" target="_blank">project 5.</a>
In this project you take a deep dive into some of my favorite music videos from some of my most beloved music genres. From rock to country to indie, you will get a little sneak peak into my diverse music taste.

        <p>This project demonstrates the proper way to use sematic HTML as well as how to embed video into your websites, a very powerful skill to know. This concept takes your website a step further than simply embedding an external link for your audience to click on. It allows for easy accessibility because it allows them to stay on your page.
